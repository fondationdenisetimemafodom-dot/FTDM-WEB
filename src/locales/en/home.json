In villages like Yantou and across Cameroon, a child’s future depends on having a classroom, a mother’s survival depends on a local clinic, and a community's spirit is tied to its heritage. The Fondation Denise Time Mafodom (FDTM) was born from this simple truth. we partner with local leaders and families, providing the essential resources they need to build lasting health, opportunity, and progress"
